# Papyrus Compendium
Hello, I am a security conscious software developer. I have been learning software development since 2008. I mostly work in .Net software, but sometimes I will work in other languages depending on the project type. I strive for readability and I am always learning new ways to make my code look clearer to anyone who may read it. I enjoy learning and I am always learning new things. Check out some of my repos, I make lots of cool thins, from stenography to neural networking.
