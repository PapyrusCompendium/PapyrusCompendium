# Papyrus Compendium
Hello, I am a professional, and security conscious software developer. I have been learning software development since 2013. I mostly work in .Net software, but sometimes I will work in other languages depending on the project type. I strive for readability and code efficiency. I enjoy learning, and I strive to always write even more bullet proof code each time. I see a very high amount of value in unit testing my code. I have professional working experience with the Azure platform using many of itâ€™s services including but not limited to Machine Learning, Azure Key Vault, Azure Functions, Azure Kubernetes Service, Devops (boards, git, and wiki+), Azure App service deployments(front end), Azure AD, and Azure SQL.
